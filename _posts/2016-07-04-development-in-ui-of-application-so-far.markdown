### Development in UI of Application so far.
For having Bookmark, CheckIn and other features in our application we thought of having it in bottom-bar but we than thought of having it as a Navigational Tool bar. So our third page of application has got some what look of Gmail app. As this feature activity is quite user friendly it serves as a more convenient way to browse around different features and looks good. We have also introduced new feature of filtration where user can filter and have search result as per his needs and convenience. The filtration page is introduced as tabbed swipe feature so that user can swipe between different pages. 
Besides this we have introduced splash screen for our application to make it look more interactive. Our Facebook and Gmail login is completely done by now and we have integrated all the code.

### What’s next in Development?

Since last week we have shifted our focus on recommender system. So we are writing the code for recommender system and hoping that we see some positive results by next week.

One of our major challenges was the data collection in finding the restaurant’s menu items. Since we didn’t find any API for restaurant’s menu, we are manually writing down the menu items of each restaurant. We are feeding in data of minimum of 10-15 food items in each restaurant. Right now we are sticking to the main course items and have excluded breakfast and drinks items from the menu.

Since our focus is to develop a product which shows best results rather than including more features, we have decided to stick to Zomato. Later, if time permits then we might include Yelp API and integrate data accordingly.

Feature of bookmark and CheckIn will also be introduced by next 2 weeks in perfect manner. Though it is not our main focus but even than we are having a slight attention and work going on in this area.

We thought of introducing many features but then we realized that it’s better to have less features implemented in perfect manner rather than having many features implemented poorly. So we have narrowed our vision and we are focusing only on those area as of now.

### Biggest Challenge!!

Our biggest challenge for now is to get all the menu item of all the restaurants. It is getting very difficult to get all the data of menu item of each restaurants. Feeding menu data is very time consuming and is not an effective way of doing it. We have continued our research for getting menu data as much as possible by hitting API in whichever way possible.
